bits is a small utility that transforms text from standard input according to a given verb.

for example, `bits urlencode < somefile.txt > output.txt` will URL encode `somefile.txt` and store output in `output.txt`. decode it with `bits urldecode`.

to see what verbs are available, call `bits` without arguments.
